## This repo contains a machine learning project I made whilst learning machine learning in order to figure out how things work. 
##### It was also majorly to figure out what's next after this but those are private personal impostor syndrome thoughts

### 'MLP' files are for the Multi Level Perceptron I created without using any major libraries (which enable us to directly import models and every tool we might need to create something like this). It is built upon the foundation of my final project for one of my grad school classes.

### 'CNN' files are for the Convolutional Neural Network. The network contains 12 different layers, each present essentially to figure out how each layer behaves and to analyse the CNN's behaviour with/without them.
